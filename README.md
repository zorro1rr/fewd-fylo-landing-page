# FEWD Project - Fylo Landing Page

![Design preview for the Fylo landing page](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. The reason for this, as opposed to including Sketch (or other similar design software) files, is to help train your eye when developing. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help when you're working on real projects, but do have access to full design files.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Suggested workflow

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1) Fork and clone this repository to begin working locally.
2) Create a new branch off of `master`.
3) Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
4) Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5) Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6) Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
7) Use JavaScript to implement client-side form validation (e.g. Display error message if input field is blank or not an email address. Otherwise, display success message).
8) Use [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/) to handle your backend form processing.
